- Using Notes API to Implement E2E Scenario on API Layer
- Using Pojo Classes for storing all Request and Response Parameters for every Endpoint with the help of Jackson Library for deserializing Json Responses into Pojo Class Objects
-	Prepare Request Body Data Statically from Mocking Server (Json Server) containing static test data & Dynamically using TimeStamp for generating dynamic test data
-	Read Request Body as Object from Pojo Class of Request & Perform Dynamic Validations on Response data against The Input Test Data stored on Pojo Class of Request whether the data is Static or Dynamic
- Using Object Model Design by setting two Object Model Classes for Request and Response of every Endpoint such that:
   - Request Object Model Class that contains all methods performed on request parameters through Request Pojo Class, including request body preparation statically or dynamically and Sending Request
   - Response Object Model Class that contains all validations and getters performed on the response parameters through Response Pojo Class"
-	Using Lombok Library for generating Setters, Getters & Constructors & ToString of All Pojo Classes, thus reduce Boiler plate Code
-	Using Builder Pattern for constructing Request Pojo Class with input parameters step by step in fluent manner to build the request body
-	Using Fluent Object Model Design Pattern in writing test script, thus chaining all requests for the E2E scenario and all validations on the responses in one line of code
-	Using Fluent Facade Design Pattern for abstracting unnecessary requests and encapsulate them into one request, thus making E2E scenario requests more short and readable
-	Using ApiManager Util that provide abstracted methods for sending all kind of requests and for different manipulations on API response
-	Allure Report for Reporting Test Result, and Logging all test Steps including sent requests and different validations on response
